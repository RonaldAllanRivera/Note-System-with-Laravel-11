# Notes Web Application

This is an open-source web application for managing notes, developed with **Laravel 11**. It provides CRUD functionality for notes and notebooks, along with user authentication and validation.

## Features

- **Authentication**:
  - Utilizes [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) for pre-configured authentication flows, including login, registration, password reset, and email verification.

- **CRUD Functionality**:
  - **Notes**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
  - **Notebooks**: Create operation only.

- **Database Relationships**:
  - **User-Note**: Notes are linked to users via a `user_id` foreign key in the `notes` table.
  - **User-Notebook**: Notebooks are linked to users via a `user_id` foreign key in the `notebooks` table.
  - **Notebook-Note**: Notes are categorized under notebooks through a `notebook_id` foreign key in the `notes` table.

- **Pagination**:
  - Implements Laravelâ€™s `paginate()` for efficient data retrieval and structured navigation.

- **Form Validation**:
  - Implements server-side validation using Laravel validation rules.
  - Ensures input persistence with the `@old` directive in Blade templates during validation errors.

- **Soft Deletes**:
  - Enables soft deletion for notes, allowing recovery of accidentally deleted items.

- **Asset Management**:
  - Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for asset bundling and live reloading during development.
  - Integrates Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling.
