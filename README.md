# Notes Web Application

This is a simple web application for managing notes, built using **Laravel 11**. It demonstrates CRUD functionality with user authentication and validation.

## Features  
- **Authentication**:  
  Implemented using [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) for secure and seamless login, registration, and password management.

- **CRUD Operations**:  
  Fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both **notes** and **notebooks**.

- **User-Specific Notes and Notebooks**:  
  - **Notes**: Linked to users via the `user_id` foreign key in the `notes` table.  
  - **Notebooks**: Linked to users via the `user_id` foreign key in the `notebooks` table.  
  - **Notebook-Note Relationship**: Notes are linked to notebooks via the `notebook_id` foreign key in the `notes` table.  
  - **Categorization**: Each note is categorized under a specific notebook, acting as its category.

- **Login Redirection**:  
  Upon successful login, users are automatically redirected to the `notes.index` page.

- **Pagination**:  
  Notes are displayed with pagination, enhancing both navigation and performance.

- **Form Validation**:  
  - Input and textarea fields are validated using Laravelâ€™s powerful validation rules.  
  - The `@old` directive is used to retain previously entered values, ensuring a seamless user experience in case of validation errors.
